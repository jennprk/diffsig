Description: Diffsig provides estimation of the associations between mutational signatures
  and risk factors to help better understand the cancer development process. 
  It generates the associations using a hierarchical Bayesian
  Dirichlet-Multinomial model with a set of mutational signatures, mutation 
  counts, and risk factors. Diffsig can test posterior estimates of the 
  associations with any type of discrete or continuous risk factors of interest
  while considering the possible variance derived by datasets sequenced with 
  various read depth.
